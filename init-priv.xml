                    <s>I'm creating this file as place where I can build a story that I don't want exposed to every audience I work with.</s>
                    <s>Yet the nature of the story I'll be trying to build here is very relevant within the scope of a greater project that will have pointers to indicate instances of this more private work aside.</s>
                    <s>The greater project is, at least initially, an attempt to organize my life.</s>
                    <s>For that, I'm working with a few AIs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Brave's Leo, etc.), some of whom require accounts.</s>
                    <s>
                      My use of the IPFS also uses a few accounts,
                      but their roles if I understand correctly are more to share (pin) files to the IPFS than to environmentally contain them like ordinary Internet file or web hosting services do.

                    <s>I've gotten used to my own interests in life being more personal than transpersonal.</s>
                    <s>
                      Even in my thinking of the world beyond myself I'm thinking of various persons,trying to comprehend what their selves' personal truths might be,
                      and I have found that many people are uncomfortable with that simple of a version of relativity.</s>
                    <s>
                      Some people are even aggressively preventative to this way of relating to human and personal life,and so in order to survive,
                      I've had to seek those persons and those environments that are for whatever reason and in whatever way more tolerant.
                    </s>
                    <s>
                      But even with best effort I'm still having trouble,
                      and so I'm interested in seeing how a more decentralized environment like the IPFS might allow me to work through the kinds of thinking I need for things like mental health.
                    </s>
                    <s>This file is the beginning of that experiment.</s>
